# Rails' Next Top Model

Without writing ActiveModel and ActiveRelation, writing your own data
layer or mapper requires reinventing lots of previous work. With the
extraction of ActiveModel and the creation of ActiveRelation, its easy
to get a quick start by cherry picking the functionality you
want. From there you can focus on making a library that is suited to
what makes your data store unique or awesome.

I hope this is helpful for getting up to speed with some of the
lower-level bits of Rails 3. If you have feedback, send me a message.
