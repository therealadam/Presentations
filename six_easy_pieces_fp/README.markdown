# Six Easy Pieces on Functional Programming

A tasting tour through some of the reasons why I find functional
programming fascinating. Covers pattern matching, tail recursion, type
classes, algebraic data types, type inference, actors, and software
transactional memory. Examples in Haskell, Erlang and Clojure.

I hope you like this. If you have feedback, send me a message.
